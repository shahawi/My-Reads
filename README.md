# MyReads Project

To install this project properly please use react and react-dom at least version 16.6.3

run npm install to install dependancies you may need to install react-router-dom manually

I am using withRouter for easier navigation from search page

To start the app use npm start

I have used react router and Links to move between pages, I removed static books all books are from the API

I made sure search is working properly also moving books from shelf to shelf is working properly

Lastly the performance should be optimised by now.
